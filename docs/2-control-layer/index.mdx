The Doubleword Control Layer is the world’s fastest AI model gateway (450x less
overhead than LiteLLM). It provides a single, high-performance interface for
routing, managing, and securing LLM inference across model providers, users and
deployments - both open-source and proprietary.

:::tip Why Use the Control Layer?
Transform your AI infrastructure from scattered API calls to a centralized, secure, and manageable platform that scales with your organization.

## Key Capabilities

<div className="capability-list">

### **OpenAI-Compatible API**

A single openAI-compatible gateway to all of your AI models across, all your
providers. Your existing code works without modification - simply point your
applications to the Control Layer's `/ai/` endpoints, and supply a control
layer API key.

### **Centralized User Management & API Key Authentication**

Manage all the users that can access all of your AI models from one simple
interface. Map users to groups, let users create their own API keys, and
monitor usage of AI APIs across your organization.

The control layer lets you turn unauthenticated, self-hosted model deployments
into production-ready services with user authentication and access control.

### **Real-Time Monitoring & Analytics**

Track request volumes, token usage, response times, and model performance
across your entire organization. Built-in analytics help you understand usage
patterns, optimize costs, and identify bottlenecks with detailed insights into
every API call. Store every request and response you send to LLM APIs for
auditing, compliance, or later fine-tuning.

*At a glance model metrics showing request counts, token usage, and average response times*

Drill down into user behaviour across providers - with opinionated analytics
for understanding which models are being used, by whom, and for what purposes.

### **Interactive AI Playgrounds**

Test and compare generative, embedding, and reranker models side-by-side with custom settings before integrating them into your applications. Experiment with different prompts, parameters, and models to find the best solution for your use case.
