# Getting Started

The Doubleword Control Layer provides a single, high-performance interface for routing, managing,
and securing inference across model providers, users and deployments - both
open-source and proprietary.

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

With docker compose installed, these commands will start the Control Layer stack:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doublewordai/control-layer/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to access the Control Layer dashboard.

## Docker Deployment

The Control Layer requires a PostgreSQL database to run. If you have one setup
already (for example, via a cloud provider), you can run:

```bash
docker run -p 3001:3001 \
    -e DATABASE_URL=<your postgres connection string here> \
    -e SECRET_KEY="mysupersecretkey" \
    ghcr.io/doublewordai/control-layer:latest
```

:::warning
Make sure to replace the secret key with a secure random value in production. You can generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

:::

Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to get started.

## Configuration

The Control Layer can be configured using a `config.yaml` file. To supply one, mount it into
the container at `/app/config.yaml`:

```bash
docker run -p 3001:3001 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=<your postgres connection string here> \
  -e SECRET_KEY="mysupersecretkey"  \
  -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml \
  ghcr.io/doublewordai/control-layer:latest
```

If using Docker Compose, the `config.yaml` file will be automatically mounted if you place it alongside `docker-compose.yml`.

See the [Configuration Reference](/docs/control-layer/reference/configuration) for detailed configuration options.

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure you've completed these steps:

1. **Database**: Set up a production-grade PostgreSQL database and configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. **Secret Key**: Generate and set a secure random secret key using `openssl rand -base64 32`
3. **Authentication**: Configure authentication settings (native login, SSO, or proxy header auth) based on your requirements
4. **CORS**: Update CORS settings to match your frontend URL
5. **User Registration**: Decide whether to enable self-service user registration or require admin-created accounts
6. **Admin Credentials**: Change the default admin password immediately after first login
